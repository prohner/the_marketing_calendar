In my day job I have heard for years from our internal team that our customers want a marketing calendar.  Since I'm more on the technical side I have always heard that this is a problem.  However I haven't heard much from anyone about what a solution to the _we don't have a marketing calendar_ problem might actually look like.  We also don't have the internal resources to work through the planning and design a project like this.

As I have watched over the years, I have come across some example of what people are doing to manage their projects.  I wouldn't even describe their work as _creating a calendar_ -- they're really just trying to manage projects.  Those projects happen to be oriented around marketing campaigns.

This is a pretty different view of the world than a standard grid-like calendar.  It's actually [a Gantt chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart).  It is great to have a Gantt view that lets you see the status of projects and their sub-tasks.  

But it is also very helpful to have a calendar view of everything that is going on.  A produce like Microsoft Project can offer a web-based calendar view of the world too.

* With a standard project management tool you don't have an easy way to recreate repetitive mini-projects (like an emailing campaign that has several steps, each with their own due dates).
* Employees/managers all have different views of the world, filtering to different levels of abstraction.
* Everyone who is involved, or interested, in a given task should be able to get updates on the task either as they happen or as part of a daily digest.
* Team members do tend to want to add comments to items on the plan.
* A marketing calendar isn't really just one project--it is an ongoing, never-ending series of projects.
* From the marketing perspective, projects are more about coordinating deadlines than allocating resources.  We care when tasks are supposed to be complete so that our event can go live.  
* We also want to know how the similar project worked out last year so we have an idea of what sort of sales we can expect this year.
* Team members are definitely not all in the same department and often are not even in the same company because vendors are involved.
