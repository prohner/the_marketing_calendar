        <title>Setting Up a Blog</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I knew up front that I wanted to set up a blog to track my work as I develop The Marketing Calendar.  And I wanted to start the blogging process before I even have an application up and running.  The plan is to write the system based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyonrails.org/&quot;&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt;.  There are more languages involved, specifically &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeescript.org/&quot;&gt;CoffeeScript&lt;/a&gt;, but the primary platform is Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of the Rails system is oriented around basic reading and writing to/from a database (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete&quot;&gt;CRUD&lt;/a&gt;).  That means there are frequent changes to the database structure.  I know from experience that during development I often like to reset the database so that it’s completely fresh.  Additionally there’s the possibility of making a mistake that wipes out the database on my development system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, I don’t trust my local database during early development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I didn’t really want to start creating blog entries in a database that I don’t trust.  I wanted to know that if I take some time to write a blog entry then that entry needs to be saved reliably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing a little research I found that creating &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics&quot;&gt;markdown files&lt;/a&gt; is pretty straightforward. Having text files on the hard drive feels like a pretty reliable way to save my blog entries.  In addition to my regular system backups, the markdown files will be included as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;revision control&lt;/a&gt;.  And, initially, the files can live anywhere on my hard drive…they don’t have to be part of a “real” application.  I like that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also been using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; text editor.  And Atom comes, by default, with a markdown preview package built-in.  Hit ctrl+shift+m and you can preview the post while you’re typing the markdown.  I like that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; can generate your blog as static web pages from your markdown files.  I followed the instructions in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sitepoint.com/jekyll-rails/&quot;&gt;helpful guide to setting up Jekyll with Rails&lt;/a&gt;.  The only issue I had was that the site suggests specifying Jekyll 2.5.3 in your Gemfile.  I was getting an error message: &lt;em&gt;Liquid Exception: Failed to get header.&lt;/em&gt;  Eventually I found that the current version of Jekyll is 3.1.2. When I changed my Gemfile then Jekyll generated the site correctly.  I like that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I can write blog posts that will be persistent before I have a real application.  The entries are also included as part of my regular backups and revision control. Those posts aren’t going anywhere.  And I like that!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome to Jekyll!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;Tom&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &#39;Hi, Tom&#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll docs&lt;/a&gt; for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;. If you have questions, you can ask them on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Getting Started on the Marketing Calendar</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In my day job I have heard for years from our internal team that our customers want a marketing calendar.  Since I’m more on the technical side I have always heard that this is a problem.  However I haven’t heard much from anyone about what a solution to the &lt;em&gt;we don’t have a marketing calendar&lt;/em&gt; problem might actually look like.  We also don’t have the internal resources to work through the planning and design a project like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have watched over the years, I have come across some example of what people are doing to manage their projects.  I wouldn’t even describe their work as &lt;em&gt;creating a calendar&lt;/em&gt; – they’re really just trying to manage projects.  Those projects happen to be oriented around marketing campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty different view of the world than a standard grid-like calendar.  It’s actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart&quot;&gt;a Gantt chart&lt;/a&gt;.  It is great to have a Gantt view that lets you see the status of projects and their sub-tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is also very helpful to have a calendar view of everything that is going on.  A produce like Microsoft Project can offer a web-based calendar view of the world too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/a8a39edf-d322-4c8d-b47f-5524aa854ac5/image/file/33121/0/Professional_Calendar_Actions.png?Id=33121 =50x50&quot; alt=&quot;Microsoft Project on the web&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With a standard project management tool you don’t have an easy way to recreate repetitive mini-projects (like an emailing campaign that has several steps, each with their own due dates).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employees/managers all have different views of the world, filtering to different levels of abstraction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everyone who is involved, or interested, in a given task should be able to get updates on the task either as they happen or as part of a daily digest.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Team members do tend to want to add comments to items on the plan.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A marketing calendar isn’t really just one project–it is an ongoing, never-ending series of projects.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From the marketing perspective, projects are more about coordinating deadlines than allocating resources.  We care when tasks are supposed to be complete so that our event can go live.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We also want to know how the similar project worked out last year so we have an idea of what sort of sales we can expect this year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Team members are definitely not all in the same department and often are not even in the same company because vendors are involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
